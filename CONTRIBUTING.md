```

## Commit messages

Use clear, imperative subject lines focused on **why** the change matters (for example: `fix: repair adaptive concurrency ramp-up`).

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; unrelated refactors belong in separate commits.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for user-visible changes.
- Ensure tests pass before opening a PR.
